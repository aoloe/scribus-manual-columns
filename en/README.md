# Column layout with Scribus

Creating columns is a task required in many layouts. Scribus has two main ways of creating columns:

- By defining columns in the text frame properties.
- By creating "Column Guides".

While using the _Automatic Text Frames_ probably seems at first very tempting, in most cases creating _Column Guides_ is the better choice.

In this tutorial will first (and mainly) focus on using the column guides. Towards the end we will go through a few cases where the _Automatic Text Frames_ are a good fit and how to use them.

## Some typical column layouts

## Adding images

Often you will need to also add a caption and a copyright notice.
